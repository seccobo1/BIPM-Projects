# BIPM-Projects
Hey there, here you can find some projects from my Business Intelligence &amp; Process Management studies.

In the following you I will list the course outlines to show what knowledge I've got from my studies so far besides the projects. So, you are also able to see what I've done in courses where I was not allowed to share my semester project here due to the fact that we've worked together with companies and their sensitive data.

## Strategic Issues of Information Technology
The module focuses on the interaction between business strategy and information technology (IT): The students shall be familiarized with an understanding of strategic management approaches from a practice-oriented perspective. Based on real life business scenarios, the relevance of IT in the context of strategy development will be discussed. These might be IT enabled business potential (e.g. by using Cloud Computing or mobile solutions) or the influence of IT on strategic decisions (e.g. during M&A Assessments).

The content will be discussed based on real business scenarios. The students have to develop or validate their own IT driven business plans or IT concept. They need to validate a given strategy for an existent company (the “client”) from an Strategic IT perspective.

### Learning Content

- Start-Ups and Entrepreneurship
- Relevance of IT aspects in the classical strategic management discipline: IT as Input and Design area


Part C: IT and Business Strategy

- IT as product (e.g. Software companies, hardware supplier, IT consulting, it service provider)
- IT based Business Models (core processes based on IT, e.g. Online-Shops or direct banking)

## Data Science
We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

With the advent of computers and the information age, statistical problems have exploded both in size and complexity. Challenges in the areas of data storage, organization and searching have led to the new field of "data science"; statistical and computational problems in biology and medicine have created "bioinformatics." Vast amounts of data are being generated in many fields, and both scientists and business majors need to understand how to learn from data.
The learning problems that we consider can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the goal is to predict the value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures; in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is to describe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures.
While some mathematical details are needed, we emphasize the methods and their conceptual underpinnings rather than their theoretical properties.

- be familiar with Bayesian ideas and terminology.
- apply validation methods such as cross-validation and the bootstrap.
- be easily able to implement a data science project in a modern language such as python.


## Data Warehousing
We are all living in the digital age, where we are faced with a continuous change in technology. As a result we witnessed an explosive growth of the amount of data that is created and we are able to store large amount of data. How can we make sense of these huge mountains of data and how can we enabling better and faster decisions for solving real-word problems?

Security threats are becoming more and more important for organisations. Additionally, governments and industry bodies getting descriptive around compliance requirements.

Today security is more than a technical theme. Security is about managing critical and sensitive informations in all kind of organisations.Therefore organizational, technical and legal requirements have to match with business processes. All aspects construct a multidimensional cube which enables a multilayer understanding and reflection of strategic, technical and business impacts as well as risks.

Compliance requirements like standards of IT security, the ISO family, national and international privacy laws reinforce the importance of information security management.
