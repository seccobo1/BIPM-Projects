# BIPM-Projects
Hey there, here you can find some projects from my Business Intelligence &amp; Process Management studies.

In the following you I will list the course outlines to show what knowledge I've got from my studies so far besides the projects. So, you are also able to see what I've done in courses where I was not allowed to share my semester project here due to the fact that we've worked together with companies and their sensitive data.

## Strategic Issues of Information Technology
The module focuses on the interaction between business strategy and information technology (IT): The students shall be familiarized with an understanding of strategic management approaches from a practice-oriented perspective. Based on real life business scenarios, the relevance of IT in the context of strategy development will be discussed. These might be IT enabled business potential (e.g. by using Cloud Computing or mobile solutions) or the influence of IT on strategic decisions (e.g. during M&A Assessments).

The content will be discussed based on real business scenarios. The students have to develop or validate their own IT driven business plans or IT concept. They need to validate a given strategy for an existent company (the “client”) from an Strategic IT perspective.

### Learning Content

Part A: Project Management and Customer Interaction

- Project Management and Procedure Models
- Consulting Approaches
- Demand vs. Delivery
- Client Interaction
- Setup of a Consulting Team
- Stakeholder Analysis


Part B: Basics of strategic management

- Basic terms and techniques of the strategic management process
- Analysis of the strategic environment, application to case studies or examples
- Strategic options, strategic choice and methods of assessing strategies
- Strategy-Life-Cycle: Development, implementation, execution and control
- Start-Ups and Entrepreneurship
- Relevance of IT aspects in the classical strategic management discipline: IT as Input and Design area


Part C: IT and Business Strategy

- IT as product (e.g. Software companies, hardware supplier, IT consulting, it service provider)
- IT based Business Models (core processes based on IT, e.g. Online-Shops or direct banking)
- IT as support function (IT as secondary activity, typically bricks and mortar companies)
- IT Governance (especially Business-IT-Alignment)
- Establishment of IT responsibilities within a company
- Strategic IT decisions, e.g. Make-or-Buy, Offshoring, Architecture Management, IT Standards


After completing this course, the students shall be able to:

- Explain the relevance of IT issues against the background of business and IT strategy
- identify central strategic issues in given practical cases and examples
- explain proven standard tools of strategic analysis and development and apply them to specific cases
- recognize and critically reflect on various stakeholder perspectives (informatics as well as business view)
- evaluate IT enabled business opportunities and develop innovative IT based business models
- manage complex client situations.


## Data Science
We are drowning in information and starving for knowledge.

With the advent of computers and the information age, statistical problems have exploded both in size and complexity. Challenges in the areas of data storage, organization and searching have led to the new field of "data science"; statistical and computational problems in biology and medicine have created "bioinformatics." Vast amounts of data are being generated in many fields, and both scientists and business majors need to understand how to learn from data.
The learning problems that we consider can be roughly categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. In supervised learning, the goal is to predict the value of an outcome measure based on a number of input measures; in unsupervised learning, there is no outcome measure, and the goal is to describe the associations and patterns among a set of input measures.
While some mathematical details are needed, we emphasize the methods and their conceptual underpinnings rather than their theoretical properties.

### Learning content:

Overview of Supervised Learning 

- Linear Models and Least Squares
- Nearest-Neighbor Methods
- Statistical Decision Theory  
- Bias-variance tradeoff
- Classification o GAMs, bootstrap


Regression

- Linear/Additive Models.   
- T-tests and F-tests


Decision Trees

- Regression Trees
- Classification Trees
- Random Forests


Modern Software

- Python


After completion of the course students should:

- have a thorough understanding of supervised methods such as (linear) regression, decision trees, generalized additive models (GAM), nearest neighbors, Kernel methods.
- fully appreciate and understand fundamental general statistical principles such as type I/II errors, bias-variance tradeoff and shrinkage.
- be familiar with Bayesian ideas and terminology.
- apply validation methods such as cross-validation and the bootstrap.
- be easily able to implement a data science project in a modern language such as python.


## Data Warehousing
We are all living in the digital age, where we are faced with a continuous change in technology. As a result we witnessed an explosive growth of the amount of data that is created and we are able to store large amount of data. How can we make sense of these huge mountains of data and how can we enabling better and faster decisions for solving real-word problems?

This course will teach students how to design data warehouse systems, visualize data with dashboards, and steer an organization in a data-driven way with corporate performance management.

### Learning Content

- Overview of Business Intelligence Systems
- Business Intelligence Lifecycle Management
- Data and Analytics as a competitive advantage: The data-driven organization

		- Management of BI in an Organization
- Data Integration and Data Quality
- Multi-Dimensional Modeling
- Implementing and Administering Data Warehouse Systems
- Techniques for Information Distribution and Analysis 
		- Multidimensional Analysis
		- Enterprise Reporting
		- Data Visualization
		- Dashboards and Portals
		- Mobile BI
- Process Intelligence and Process Mining
- Platforms for Data Storage and Analysis 
		- Enterprise Data Warehouse and Data Marts
		- Relational and Multi-dimensional Databases
		- In-Memory Databases
		- Big Data
- Usage of BI in 
		- Marketing, Customer Relationship, Sales Management and Web Analytics
		- Controlling, Finance and Human Resources
		- Production, Logistics and Supply Chain Management
		- Strategic and Competitive Intelligence


After completion of the course students should:

- have an overview of the different elements of Business Intelligence
- have gained an in-depth understanding of the conceptual foundations of BI
- be able to choose appropriate Data Warehouse Systems for different business problems
- be able to design and implement Data Warehouse Systems
